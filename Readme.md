# JPDB-connect

At the moment this program has two features:
- open vocab that is added via yomichan in a jpdb-tab (does not require login)
- automatically add that vocab to a specified deck (does require session cookie, need to edit config)

## How to use:

Download a binary from releases and run it.

Set up Yomichan to look for a server at localhost:3030
